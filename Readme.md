Get back your tab sanity on chrome..
We have all been there, too many disorganised tabs.
Tabnet takes a different approach to this.

Get a handy set of keyboard shortcuts that lets you tame your tabs.

### [Alt+Shift+G] Arrange all tabs by domain

Arranges all open tabs by their hostname
and auto renames the tab group accordingly.

### [Alt+Shift+G] Add tab to a group

That special case when you want to create a group by the the title of the tab.

If the current tab is pinned its unpinned.

### [Alt+Shift+G] Hibernate the current tab

Hibernates a tab and frees up memory.
Hibernated tabs are still visible on the tab strip.
They are reloaded when activated.
